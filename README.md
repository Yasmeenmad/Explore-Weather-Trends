# Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree Project 1
## Exploring Weather Trends

### Summary
In this project, we have analyzed local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where we live to overall global temperature trends.

### Instructions
our goal will be to create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city to where we live. To do this, We have taken the following steps:

- Extract the data from the database. We have exported the temperature data for the world as well as for the closest big city to where you live from 'city_list' table. To interact with the database, We needed to write a SQL query.

- Open up the CSV in Excel.

- Create a line chart that compares our city’s temperatures with the global temperatures. We make sure to plot the moving average rather than the yearly averages in order to smooth out the lines, making trends more observable.

- Make observations about the similarities and differences between the world averages and our city’s averages, as well as overall trends.
